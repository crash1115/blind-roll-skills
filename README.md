## No Longer Being Maintained
Due to time constraints, I'm no longer able to keep updating this module with any amount of frequency. You're welcome to keep using it; there's a decent chance that it'll get updated from time to time because my group uses it, but I won't be keeping up with feature requests or non-critical bug reports at the level that'd be expected for something actively being maintained. Thanks for sticking with me on this wild ride, it's been a lot of fun!

# Crash's Automatic Blind Rolls (5e)
This is a module for dnd5e that allows the DM to always hide the results of specified skills or death saves from players. This is handy in case you don't want the results of an Insight or Perception check to tip your players off.
